# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
_It was defintely challenging to work through, but through my own research and a little help from my support network I think I got it!_
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
_So far I am doing pretty well at taking regular breaks and stepping outside to stay fresh._
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
_I think I need to really be diligent with my sleep schedule, I really notice when I don't sleep well..._
